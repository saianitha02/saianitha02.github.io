## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
for(i in 1:4){ # R syntax to implement a for loop
    i = i + 2 # R's syntax for increment by 1
    cat(i,'\n')}
```

## **Running Python inside Rmarkdown**

```{python}
for i in range(1,5): # For loop for range 2 to 4
    i += 2 # Python allows shorthand increment syntax
    print(i)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
